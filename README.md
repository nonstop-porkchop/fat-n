A feedist social network project.

## Planned Features

#### Audience Selection
Make posts to specific audiences like your close friends, your fans or enjoyers of a specific kink. Inclusively or exclusively with the wider community.
Fat~N aims to give you control of the people you reach out to and the people you don't.

#### Ensured Feeding
Fat~N connects feeders directly to delivery services like Uber Eats and Door Dash, while protecting the feedee's address. We're aiming to put more food
in the hands of feedees and less money in scammers bank accounts.

#### Creator Marketplace
Fat~N supports a diverse range of community members, including those who work to make the content we all appreciate. The Creator Marketplace
is an area of Fat~N that will allow users to browse and sell content.

#### Conversation Briefings
Every feedist is different and Fat~N aims to support that. Each conversation will start with the participants being
briefed on what is and is not okay to talk to that user about.

#### Google Fit Integration
Boast your metrics in real time with data from your weight and fitness tracking systems.
